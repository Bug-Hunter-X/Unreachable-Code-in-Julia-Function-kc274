# Unreachable Code in Julia

This example demonstrates a common error in Julia: unreachable code.  The final `return 0` statement in `myfunction` will never execute because the preceding `if` and `else` blocks handle all possible cases.  This type of error can impact code clarity and might even cause unexpected behavior if later modifications alter the code's logic.

The solution involves removing the unnecessary `return 0` statement.
